# Apache Arrow ADBC: Node.js Bindings

This directory contains the Node.js implementation of the [Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC)](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/) standard.

## Project Structure

- **[`native`](./native)**: The primary package (`adbc-driver-manager`). This is a Node.js native addon (using [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html)) built with Rust. It provides the ADBC Driver Manager interface.
- **[`core`](./core)**: Internal Rust crate containing shared logic and type definitions used by the native bindings.

## Getting Started

To use the ADBC driver in your Node.js project, see the documentation in the **[`native`](./native)** directory.

## Building from Source

This project uses `npm` workspaces and Rust.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command builds the Rust native modules and the TypeScript wrappers.

3.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
