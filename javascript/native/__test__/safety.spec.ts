  // Rationale:
  // The ADBC C API Specification states regarding Resource Management:
  // "Releasing a parent object does not automatically release child objects, but it may invalidate them."
  // (https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/c/api/index.html#resource-management)
  //
  // In a raw C application, accessing a Child (Iterator) after closing the Parent (Connection)
  // would often result in a Use-After-Free (Segfault).
  //
  // However, in Node.js, a Segfault is unacceptable. This driver implementation (via the Rust adbc_driver_manager)
  // uses Reference Counting (Arc) to manage the lifecycle of the underlying C structs.
  // When we "Close" the connection in JavaScript, we are releasing the JavaScript handle's
  // reference to the resource.
  //
  // The Iterator (Reader) holds its own strong reference to the underlying Statement/Connection
  // to ensure it can safely finish reading. The actual C-level teardown of the Connection
  // only occurs when *all* references (Connection handle + all active Iterators) are dropped.
  //
  // This test verifies that "Safety" mechanism: ensuring that premature closure of the parent
  // handle does not crash the process or interrupt the child stream.
  const { stmt, conn, db } = t.context

  if (!stmt || !conn || !db) {
    t.fail('Setup failed')
    return
  }

  // 2. Get Reader (which holds iterator)
  const reader = await stmt.executeQuery()
  t.pass('Got reader')

  // 3. Close Statement and Connection immediately
  // The Iterator (inside Reader) should keep the underlying resources alive.
  await stmt.close()
  // Mark as closed in context so after hook doesn't complain (though we have try/catch)
  delete t.context.stmt

  await conn.close()
  delete t.context.conn

  await db.close()
  delete t.context.db

  t.pass('Resources closed')

  // 4. Iterate
  let rowCount = 0
  for await (const batch of reader) {
    t.pass(`Read batch with ${batch.numRows} rows from orphaned iterator`)
    rowCount += batch.numRows
    const valVector = batch.getChild('val')
